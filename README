Little programs that run routines from inside the Stanford NLP system:

 * Depper: runs the Stanford Dependency coverter on PTB-style phrase structure
   trees from standard input.  Runs the lemmatizer too.  Works with Stanford
   CoreNLP version 2012-01-08.  Outputs either CoNLL format, or a JSON-based
   format.  If using PTB gold-standard parses, make sure to remove traces
   first: e.g. with wsj-removetraces.pl from srlconll-1.1.

 * StanfordParserServer: a socket (telnet) server to get a phrase-structure
   parse from a sentence.  It requires some old version of the Stanford parser,
   maybe circa 2008-9 or so; this should be updated.

No guarantee of consistency or usability given, please read the code before
using.
